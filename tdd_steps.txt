step-1 Quickly add a test:
    select a test case from to-do list
    write a test case clearly(proper build, checking types of the arguments that are passed, proper assertions)
    and see it fail because of compilation error

step -2 run all tests and see the new one fail :
    implement details just enough to get the state of test case from compilation error state to red state

step 3 make a little change:
    Now implement the functionality just enough to pass the test case if the functionality is obvious
    if functionality is not obvious use fake implementation to pass it

step 4 run all test s and see them all succeed:
    run all tests and get the test case to the green state

step 5 Refactor to remove duplication:
    Refactor the code based on the checklist we have and then test the code again to ensure that tests wont fail
    update to-do list
    check code from different person point of view


proper - derive from use case
red state - define what it is?
write new test case with different parameters and repeat the above steps
