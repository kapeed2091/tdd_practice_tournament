step-1:
    select a test case from to-do list
    write a test case clearly(proper build, checking types of the arguments that are passed, proper assertions)
    and see it fail because of compilation error

step -2:
    implement details just enough to get the state of test case from compilation error state to red state

step 3
    Now implement the functionality just enough to pass the test case if the functionality is obvious
    if functionality is not obvious use fake implementation to pass it and then write new test case
    with different parameters and repeat the above steps
    Based on the two test cases write the implementation and get the test case to the green state

step 4
    Refactor the code based on the checklist we have and then test the code again to ensure that tests wont fail

step 5
    write a new test case and repeat the process
