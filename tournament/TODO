         1. Progress winner of the match to next round
         2. If there is no round to progress, raise an exception

   - User can get the winner user profile of any tournament
         1. User can get winner user profile of a tournament

ASSUMPTIONS:
   1. Assuming the Match model will have the following fields
          a. match_id
          b. user
          c. tournament
          d. score(default=0) and Integer Field
          e. status
          f. round
          g. user_status('WIN', 'LOST', 'NOT_DECIDED_YET')

   2. Assuming after play_match is called by user, match status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   3. After the tournament reach start_datetime, status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS' else will be in 'YET_TO_START'
   5. Assuming there will be required number of matches already created in each round of a tournament
   6. Assuming the default value of user_status field in Match model is 'NOT_DECIDED_YET'
   7. To progress user to next round we will give a random match
   8. Assuming default age of user is '0'(UN_KNOWN)
DOUBTS:
   1. Can user play same match multiple times.
   2. Will there be any time constraints to play a match
   3. Can the use submit scores multiple times for the same match
   4. If the User does not submit the score, will the default=0
   5. Will we call progress_winner independently at a particular time for all users in tournament or
      will we call it for each match after both the users submit there score..etc
   6. How will we decide, which match in the next round should be assigned to the winner of current match
   7. If the Users didn't play the match by the time we run progress_winner_to_next_round, what should we do?
