TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

IN_PROGRESS:

COMPLETED:
   - There should be a Match for an user to play(Dependent Task)
          a. Don't know how to implement TDD to just add model. Have to discuss

   - User can play matches once the tournament is started
          1. User can play match
          2. If User try to play match where tournament has not started, raise an exception
          3. Invalid user id
          4. Invalid match id
          5. User does not belong to the match
      - User will submit his score in the match
          1. User will submit score for a match
          2. Invalid User id
          3. Invalid Match id
          4. User does not belong to the match
   - Match model should have fields round and user_status[Dependent]
         a. Don't know how to do TDD for this case

   - User will progress to next round if he wins the match
         1. Progress winner of the match to next round
         2. If there is no round to progress, raise an exception

   - Select a Match in the next round to the winner of the current round (Dependent)
         1. return match where it should not have user assigned to it
         2. If there are no matches vacant int the round, raise an exception

ASSUMPTIONS:
   1. Assuming the Match model will have the following fields
          a. match_id
          b. user
          c. tournament
          d. score(default=0) and Integer Field
          e. status
          f. round
          g. user_status('WIN', 'LOST', 'NOT_DECIDED_YET')

   2. Assuming after play_match is called by user, match status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   3. After the tournament reach start_datetime, status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS' else will be in 'YET_TO_START'
   5. Assuming there will be required number of matches already created in each round of a tournament
   6. Assuming the default value of user_status field in Match model is 'NOT_DECIDED_YET'
   7. To progress user to next round we will give a random match
DOUBTS:
   1. Can user play same match multiple times.
   2. Will there be any time constraints to play a match
   3. Can the use submit scores multiple times for the same match
   4. If the User does not submit the score, will the default=0
   5. Will we call progress_winner independently at a particular time for all users in tournament or
      will we call it for each match after both the users submit there score..etc
   6. How will we decide, which match in the next round should be assigned to the winner of current match
   7. If the Users didn't play the match by the time we run progress_winner_to_next_round, what should we do?
