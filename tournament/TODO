TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

IN_PROGRESS:
   - User can play matches once the tournament is started
     - User will submit his score in the match
         4. User does not belong to the match


COMPLETED:
   - There should be a Match for an user to play(Dependent Task)
          a. Don't know how to implement TDD to just add model. Have to discuss

   - User can play matches once the tournament is started
          1. User can play match
          2. If User try to play match where tournament has not started, raise an exception
          3. Invalid user id
          4. Invalid match id
          5. User does not belong to the match
      - User will submit his score in the match
          1. User will submit score for a match
          2. Invalid User id
          3. Invalid Match id

ASSUMPTIONS:
   1. Assuming the Match model will have the following fields
          a. match_id
          b. user
          c. tournament
          d. score(default=0) and Integer Field
          e. status

   2. Assuming after play_match is called by user, match status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   3. After the tournament reach start_datetime, status will change to 'IN_PROGRESS' else will be in 'YET_TO_START'
DOUBTS:
   1. Can user play same match multiple times.
   2. Will there be any time constraints to play a match
   3. Can the use submit scores multiple times for the same match
   4. If the User does not submit the score, will the default=0
