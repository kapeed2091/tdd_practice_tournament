Usecases:

Yet to do:
   - User can get list of all tournaments (id, name, number of rounds, start_datetime, tournament_status)
        - Should return empty list if no tournaments
        - User should be registered
   - User can subscribe to a tournament which is not yet started
   - User can play matches once the tournament is started
       - User will submit his score in the match
   - User will progress to next round if he wins the match
   - User can get his current round number for a tournament
   - User can get his opponent user profile in any round in a tournament
   - User can get the winner user profile of any tournament

Completed:
   - User can create a knock-out tournament with configurable number of rounds and start datetime
        - Number of rounds should be non-negative integer
        - Number of rounds should be int type
        - Start datetime must be greater than now
        - User should be registered with us to create a tournament
        - Tournament id (t_id) should be unique
        - Tournament status should be CAN_JOIN when created
   - User can get list of all tournaments (id, name, number of rounds, start_datetime, tournament_status)
        - Should return empty list if no tournaments

Raise Appropriate custom exceptions wherever necessary

Assumptions:
   - Tournament will always be full before start time
   - All players will play all their matches
   - In case of tie, Whoever submits the score first is winner
   - User profile has Name, Age, Gender
   - tournament_status - CAN_JOIN, FULL_YET_TO_START, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED.

My Assumptions:
   - Tournament name length is less than 30
   - Changed id field in tournament to t_id with max length 20
   - Timezone warning is reported in terminal, couldn't find suitable way to handle it
   - default status of tournament is CAN_JOIN
   - Userprofile has extra field user_id which is unique
   - user_id max length is 20
   - Immediately after creating tournament, we are updating status to CAN_JOIN (No specific time when the subscription begins)

Time estimate:
   - Hrs - 2, 0.5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0.5, 1, buffer 3
